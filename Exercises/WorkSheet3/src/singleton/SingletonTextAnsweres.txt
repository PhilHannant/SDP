(a) How could we use the synchronized keyword to the getInstance() method to operate correctly.

    Add synchronized to the method signature

(b) The synchronised version comes with a price as it will decrease the performance of the code — why?

    Every thread will also have to be synchronised and therefore will have to wait to be notified before being able to
    access getInstance.

(c) If the call to the getInstance() method isn’t causing a substantial overhead for your application, then you can
    forget about it.

    Not sure what the question is?
