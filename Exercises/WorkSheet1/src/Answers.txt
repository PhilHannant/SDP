1. What are the reasons for using generics here?
Allows for the use of multiple types.

2. What are the benefits?
It means that a programmer can create classes which can be used with different types.

3. What is the cause of the problem reported by the compiler, if any?
myAccount needs to be cast

4. How does this affect the compilation process?
   What is the problem, if any?
   What does the myAccount variable hold when the code is executed?

   Still fails, compiler asks for a cast. Won't compile, incompatible types.

5. What does the dynamic cast do here?
   Is it the compiler that performs the cast operation or the Java runtime environment (JVM)?
   Is this code safe?

   The cast converts the object to the same type as bank account, the cast is carried out in the JVM.

6. Explain the compiler output?
   Are there errors?
   What is the reason?
   What does it say about the role of generics?

   Compiles without errors because generics ensure everything is defined correctly.

7. What is the run-time output?
   Explain why you get such output and how does this relate to generics and their use with
   reflective instantiation of objects?

   115.0 EQUAL
   Because of type erassure at run-time classes will be consdered equal at run-time as they will both be considered
   the superclass at run-time
