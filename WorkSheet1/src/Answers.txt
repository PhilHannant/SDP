1. What are the reasons for using generics here?
Allows for the use of multiple types.

2. What are the benefits?
It means that a programmer can create classes which can be used with different types.

3. What is the cause of the problem reported by the compiler, if any?
myAccount needs to be cast

4. How does this affect the compilation process?
   What is the problem, if any?
   What does the myAccount variable hold when the code is executed?

   Still fails, compiler asks for a cast. Won't compile, incompatible types.

5. What does the dynamic cast do here?
   Is it the compiler that performs the cast operation or the Java runtime environment (JVM)?
   Is this code safe?

   The cast converts the object to the same type as bank account, the cast is carried out in the JVM.
